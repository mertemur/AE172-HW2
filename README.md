# AE172-HW2
 Aerospace Homework
  This project is created only for educational purposes. I will not publish the original question until my lecturer lets me do.
  Although this program gives a solution for one specific question, I will use some of the parts to create a more general program, that's why I publish it.
  
  Math, matplotlib, and numpy libraries are used in this project.

  Variables at the top are the constants that are given by the question.

  One important point is that I neglected the effect of flight path angle on thrust, lift coefficient, etc. Only considered in the sixth question, while plotting lift coefficient versus altitude graph.

  All the equations used in the project are either direct formulas, derivatives of them, or manipulated versions of them. 
  
  By executing, you can get solutions for the question part by part. The table's link is: https://www.digitaldutch.com/atmoscalc/table.htm#
  Graphs can be found in the same folder as the program itself in png format.
